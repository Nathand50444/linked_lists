linked-list

This is the linked list project as a part of The Odin Project (TOP) and aims to demonstrate my basic proficiency on Computer Science, learnt from the Ruby path from the Odin Project.

The software replicates the functionality of a linked list â€” a data structure common in other programming languages, though not natively supported in Ruby. The repository includes two files: linked_list.rb and main.rb. The linked_list.rb file implements the functions needed to simulate a linked list class, while main.rb serves as a test environment for the linked list "class," complete with an example program. You can modify main.rb to utilize all the features provided by linked_list.rb.

How does it work?
In order to run this, you need to open the Git/Linux/MacOS terminal and navigate to ../linked-list and then run ruby main.rb to see the results coming from that file.
